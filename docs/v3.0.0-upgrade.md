# v3.0.0 Upgrade Details

Loki v3.0.0 instituted a new default limit of 15 labels which is a decrease from the previous limit of 30.

This is the explanataion provided by the Grafana team:

> Loki now enforces a max label limit of 15 labels per series, down from 30. Extra labels inflate the size of the index and reduce performance, you should almost never need more than 15 labels.

Updates have been made to fluentbit and promtail to promote staying within this limit and all Big Bang package logs are compliant with it.

However, it is possible that custom configurations may exceed this limit. If you are negatively affected by this change, please review the instructions below to guide you in changing the limit to a more suitable value.

## Instructions
> Note: This is not supported by BigBang as Grafana Labs explictly states this can reduce performance. Increased limits are used at your own risk.

You will need to supply a `limits_config` map in the `loki.values` section of your `values.yaml` file. This map should contain a `max_label_names_per_series` key with the desired limit as an integer value. For example, to set the limit to 30 labels, you would add the following to your Big Bang umbrella chart's `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
loki:
  values:
    limits_config:
      max_label_names_per_series: 25
```
